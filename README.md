Recommendations for Setting Limits on Amazon Connect Queues
Since your contact center handles over 400,000 calls daily, not having queue limits in place can lead to severe operational challenges, including excessive wait times, agent overload, system performance issues, and poor customer experience. Here’s a structured approach to optimizing queue limits:

🔹 Identified Issues Due to No Queue Limits
Unlimited Call Queues Can Cause:
Long Wait Times – Calls can pile up indefinitely, frustrating customers.
Agent Overload – Even with proper workforce management, agents might get overwhelmed with no control over the influx of calls.
Increased Abandonment Rates – Customers may drop off before speaking to an agent due to long waits.
Amazon Connect Performance Risks – High concurrency without rate limits may impact API response times and Lambda executions.
Compliance & SLA Risks – Not meeting Service Level Agreements (SLA) due to long queue times.
🔹 Recommended Queue Limit Strategy
1. Implement Maximum Queue Capacity
Set a hard limit for how many calls can be queued at any given time.
Example:
If 400,000 calls/day = ~16,666 calls per hour (assuming 24/7 operations).
If business hours are 12 hours/day, peak load could be 33,000 calls per hour.
Solution: Set queue limits per hour based on average handling time (AHT) and agent availability.
Suggested Limits:
Queue Type	Max Concurrent Calls	Max Queue Wait Time
General Support	500 per queue	10 minutes
Premium/VIP Customers	200 per queue	3 minutes
Billing/Payments	300 per queue	8 minutes
Tech Support	400 per queue	12 minutes
➡️ Use Amazon Connect Contact Flow settings to enforce these limits.

2. Enable Dynamic Queue Prioritization
Prioritize VIP customers over general support.
Use queue time thresholds to escalate waiting calls.
Example: If a call waits >5 minutes in General Support, offer callback or alternative contact methods.
3. Implement Automatic Call Overflow Handling
✅ If a queue is full, route calls dynamically:

Self-Service (IVR & Chatbot): Offer automated assistance via Amazon Lex or an FAQ system.
Call Deflection: Provide SMS/Web chat options for non-urgent queries.
Scheduled Callbacks: Instead of waiting, schedule a callback based on agent availability.
➡️ Amazon Connect Contact Flow should be configured to trigger overflow routing.

4. Optimize Agent Workforce Management (WFM)
✅ Match Agent Capacity to Call Volume

Increase staffing during peak hours.
Use Amazon Connect Historical Metrics to predict call surges.
Enable auto-adjustments to routing based on real-time queue load.
➡️ Use AWS Forecast or AI-driven Workforce Optimization (WFO) tools to predict call traffic trends.

5. Set Up Alerts & Monitoring for Queue Performance
✅ Implement Amazon CloudWatch Alarms to Monitor:

Queue Wait Times Exceeding Threshold
High Call Abandonment Rate (>15%)
Agent Occupancy Reaching 90%+
Lambda/API Gateway Timeout Errors Due to High Load
S3 Storage Growth (Call Recordings/Transcriptions Exceeding Limits)
➡️ Use Grafana, Splunk, or QuickSight Dashboards for Real-Time Monitoring.

🔹 Final Action Plan
