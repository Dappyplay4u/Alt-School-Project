7.1 Daily Checks
Health Monitoring for Key Services
Daily monitoring ensures that all critical services are operational, and potential issues are detected early. Key tasks include:

Amazon CloudWatch Dashboards: Review system health metrics such as call volumes, latency, and API request failures.
Amazon Connect Call Routing Performance: Verify that calls are correctly routed to available agents.
Lambda Function Logs: Check AWS Lambda functions for errors that might impact IVR performance or data flows.
Queue Metrics Monitoring: Ensure that no queues are overloaded, leading to long customer wait times.
SIP Trunk & Telephony Health: Validate telephony connections to prevent call failures.
Agent Availability Checks: Ensure that agent status updates are correctly reflected in the system.
7.2 Monthly Maintenance
Log File Analysis & Backup Validation
Review Amazon CloudWatch and CloudTrail Logs: Identify trends, failures, or security incidents.
Validate S3 Storage for Call Recordings & Logs: Ensure compliance with data retention policies.
Backup Integrity Testing: Test stored backups for recoverability in case of incidents.
Database Performance Checks: Review Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon RDS logs to prevent slow queries or capacity throttling.
7.3 Quarterly Maintenance
Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan Testing
To ensure business continuity, perform regular DR testing, including:

Amazon Connect Instance Failover Simulation: Validate failover mechanisms in case of region failures.
Data Restoration Testing: Verify that call logs and recorded conversations can be restored from Amazon S3 backups.
IVR & Contact Flow Redundancy Testing: Confirm that automated flows are resilient to failures.
