Operational Manual for Amazon Connect and NexTalk Contact Center Solution
1. High-Level Overview
The system integrates Amazon Connect, NexTalk infrastructure, PEGA CRM, and supporting AWS services to provide a multi-channel contact center solution. It supports various service delivery methods like voice, chat, email, and video. Real-time monitoring and analytics tools like Splunk, Dynatrace, and Amazon QuickSight are utilized for operational insights.

2. Key Components and Their Roles
A. Service Delivery Options
Channels: Email, web, chat, video, voice/SMS.
Purpose: Interface for customer interactions routed to the contact center through various channels.
B. AWS Connect Ecosystem
Amazon Connect:
Manages voice and chat traffic through its contact flows.
Integrates with Lambda functions, Amazon Lex, and Amazon DynamoDB for advanced functionality.
Amazon Lex:
Used for conversational AI to enable intelligent chat/voice interactions.
AWS Lambda:
Executes backend logic to process contact flows, integrate data, and handle real-time events.
Amazon S3 and Kinesis:
Call and IVR transaction data are streamed to Kinesis and stored in S3.
Enables event-driven processing and analytics through Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight.
Amazon EventBridge:
Manages events for orchestration across the contact center solution.
Amazon DynamoDB:
Stores call and IVR transaction data for rapid retrieval.
C. NexTalk Infrastructure
NexTalk Server:
Handles TTY phone number calls and bridges chat sessions.
NexTalk API Server:
Facilitates communication between NexTalk and other systems like Amazon Connect.
Chat Bridge (TTY-Chat Session):
Acts as a middleware to ensure connectivity between NexTalk and Amazon Connect.
Amazon RDS:
Manages NexTalkâ€™s configuration files in a SQL Server database.
D. PEGA CRM
Workflow Data:
Manages case management workflows and screen pop-ups for agents.
PEGA CM Stream:
Handles real-time data flow for better customer interaction management.
E. Monitoring Tools
Splunk and Dynatrace:
Real-time system monitoring for logs and performance.
Amazon QuickSight:
Visualizes analytics for call/IVR data stored in S3 or DynamoDB.
F. SSA IVR Services
Provides IVR functionality for the system, routing calls and coordinating with NexTalk.
G. AWS Direct Connect
Enables a dedicated network connection to AWS services, ensuring low latency and secure communication.
3. Workflow Explanation
Customer Interaction:

Customers initiate interactions via email, web, chat, video, or voice/SMS.
Voice calls or TTY phone numbers are routed through NexTalk infrastructure.
Routing and Processing:

Calls are routed through Amazon Connect and processed by associated Lambda functions.
Amazon Lex handles AI-driven conversational flows for chat or voice.
TTY and chat sessions are routed via the Chat Bridge to Amazon Connect.
Data Storage and Processing:

Call and IVR transaction data are streamed to Amazon Kinesis.
Data is stored in DynamoDB for quick retrieval and analyzed using Athena and QuickSight.
CRM Integration:

PEGA CRM retrieves case-specific workflows and provides screen pop-ups for agents, streamlining customer support.
Monitoring:

Real-time monitoring of infrastructure and application performance is handled by Splunk, Dynatrace, and Amazon CloudWatch.
4. Operational Guidelines
A. System Monitoring
Tools Used: Splunk, Dynatrace, Amazon CloudWatch.
Metrics to Monitor:
Health of Lambda functions, NexTalk servers, and Chat Bridge.
Call/IVR data throughput in Kinesis and S3.
CRM workflow processing times and accuracy.
B. Troubleshooting
Connectivity Issues (NexTalk and Amazon Connect):

Check NexTalk server logs located in C:\ProgramData\NexTalk\Logs.
Verify DNS and network connectivity between servers.
Ensure that the Chat Bridge service is running.
Service Failures:

Restart affected Windows services on NexTalk servers (e.g., App API, Chat Bridge).
Check AWS Lambda logs for errors using Amazon CloudWatch.
High Latency or Performance Issues:

Monitor Kinesis stream latency using CloudWatch.
Check DynamoDB throughput and scaling metrics.
Ensure sufficient ports are available on NexTalk servers for call handling.
C. Maintenance
Weekly Tasks:
Review logs for errors or warnings in NexTalk and Amazon Connect.
Verify system health metrics in Splunk and Dynatrace.
Monthly Tasks:
Audit call/IVR data for anomalies.
Review port utilization and scale resources if needed.
Quarterly Tasks:
Apply updates to NexTalk servers and AWS resources.
Perform disaster recovery drills using Direct Connect and backup data in S3.
5. Disaster Recovery Plan
System Backup:

Regularly back up NexTalk configurations stored in Amazon RDS.
Ensure call/IVR data in DynamoDB is backed up to S3.
Failover Mechanism:

NexTalk infrastructure uses two servers for redundancy. Ensure that one server can handle traffic if the other fails.
AWS services are inherently redundant and scalable.
Testing:

Schedule quarterly failover tests for NexTalk servers and AWS Direct Connect.
6. Recommendations
Automation: Use AWS Systems Manager for patch management on NexTalk servers.
Documentation Updates: Maintain detailed records of changes in the workflow or configurations.
Training: Provide regular training for staff on using monitoring tools and troubleshooting.
