6.1 Incident Response Plan

A structured incident response plan is crucial for maintaining system reliability and ensuring quick resolution of issues within Amazon Connect. The plan follows these key steps:

Identifying and Classifying Incidents

All incidents are categorized based on impact and urgency to determine response priority.

Automated monitoring tools (e.g., Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail) detect anomalies and generate alerts.

Initial triage is performed to classify the incident severity (P1 to P4) and assign it to the appropriate response team.

Escalation Workflow

P1 (Critical Impact): Immediate response required; escalated to cloud engineers and AWS support within 5 minutes.

P2 (High Impact): Significant service degradation; addressed within 30 minutes, escalated if not resolved.

P3 (Medium Impact): Minor disruptions requiring investigation; addressed within 2 hours.

P4 (Low Impact): Informational alerts; analyzed in scheduled system health reviews.

Incident notifications are sent via Amazon SNS, ServiceNow, or Slack to notify relevant teams.

Communication Plan

Incident Bridges: Real-time collaboration via Teams, Slack, or Zoom to discuss response strategies.

Status Updates: Regular updates via email or chat until resolution is reached.

Customer Notifications: If service impact is external, timely updates are shared via AWS Health Dashboard or corporate communication channels.

6.2 Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

After an incident is resolved, a structured Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is conducted to prevent recurrence. The process includes:

Incident Documentation: Detailed logging of event timelines, impact, and actions taken.

Root Cause Investigation: Identify the underlying issue through log analysis, historical data, and service dependencies.

Preventive Actions: Develop corrective measures such as infrastructure optimizations, automation improvements, or policy updates.

Stakeholder Review: Share findings with IT, DevOps, and security teams to ensure continuous learning.

6.3 Post-Incident Review and Documentation

All major incidents undergo a post-mortem review to assess response effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.

Reports are stored in Confluence, ServiceNow, or internal documentation repositories for future reference.

Lessons learned are used to refine monitoring, automation, and response workflows.
