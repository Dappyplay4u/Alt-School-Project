Operational Manual for Amazon Connect Contact Center Solution
1. Introduction
Purpose:
This manual outlines the processes and standards for managing the Amazon Connect Contact Center Solution infrastructure, ensuring reliability, performance, and compliance.

Scope:
Includes configuration, monitoring, maintenance, incident response, and disaster recovery for Amazon Connect and its integrated services.

Audience:
Operations, IT, and support teams responsible for managing the contact center infrastructure.

2. Platform Overview
Architecture Summary:
Diagram of Amazon Connect and associated services (e.g., Lambda, DynamoDB, Lex, S3, CloudWatch).

Key Components:

Amazon Connect: Manages voice, chat, and contact flows.
AWS Lambda: Automates custom workflows.
Amazon Lex: Powers intelligent virtual agents.
DynamoDB: Stores contact attributes and metadata.
CloudWatch: Monitors performance and alerts.
3. Alerts and Monitoring
Existing Alerts:

Call Volume: High concurrent calls.
Queue Wait Times: Wait time exceeds defined thresholds.
Missed Calls: Number of missed calls within a timeframe.
Lambda Errors: Invocation errors, timeouts.
DynamoDB Throughput: Consumed read/write capacity units.
New Alerts to Implement:

Lex Bot Errors: Failure rates for bot responses.
S3 Bucket Access: Unusual access patterns.
API Gateway Latency: Response time thresholds.
Action Plan for Alerts:

High Priority: Immediate escalation to on-call engineer.
Medium Priority: Log and monitor for trends.
Low Priority: Schedule for review during maintenance.
Thresholds and Metrics:

Define KPIs (e.g., call abandonment rates, queue durations).
Example:
Queue wait times: >2 minutes triggers an alert.
DynamoDB read/write capacity: >85% usage triggers scaling.
4. Maintenance Tasks
Daily Tasks:

Check health of Lambda functions, Lex bots, and DynamoDB.
Review CloudWatch logs for anomalies.
Monthly Tasks:

Validate backup integrity for S3 and DynamoDB.
Review and update alert thresholds.
Quarterly Tasks:

Test disaster recovery (ACGR failover simulation).
Apply patches to Lambda runtime and other services.
5. Incident Management
Outage Procedures:

Identify affected services (e.g., Amazon Connect, Lex, Lambda).
Notify stakeholders using pre-defined communication templates.
Mitigation steps:
Verify CloudWatch alarms.
Check impacted resources (e.g., DynamoDB read/write limits).
Execute rollback plans if changes caused the issue.
Impact Assessment:

Evaluate customer impact.
Categorize severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
Root Cause Analysis (RCA):

Document details:
Incident timeline.
Root cause.
Mitigation and prevention actions.
6. Disaster Recovery (ACGR)
Overview:
Amazon Connect Resiliency features and AWS Region failover plans.

Disaster Recovery Plan:

Primary Region: List AWS resources and configurations.
Failover Region: Mirror primary setup with automation scripts.
Failover Process:

Automated scaling and rerouting via Route 53.
Validation checklist post-failover.
Testing and Validation:

Schedule quarterly DR tests.
Document outcomes and improvements.
7. Change Management
Change Request Workflow:

Submit request with details.
Evaluate impact, test in staging, and approve via CAB.
Implement during scheduled maintenance windows.
Post-Implementation Validation:

Monitor system performance and validate changes.
Update related documentation in Confluence.
8. Reports and Analytics
Performance Metrics:

Call handling times, agent availability, queue lengths.
Monthly trends: Compare KPIs to historical benchmarks.
Active Monitoring Tools:

Grafana dashboards linked to CloudWatch.
Alerts visualized for quick decision-making.
Scheduled Reports:
